## Welcome!

Hello, and welcome to LeetPython! We're glad to have with you with us. Whether you're just starting your journey into Python or a Python pro, you've come to the right place to learn more about Python.

<!--truncate-->

At LeetPython, our mission is to become the ultimate resource for all things Python. Here you're find everything- from the very basics of Python and all the way to its application in all sorts of things- from domain specific (such as machine learning and data analytics) to general programming (such as algorithms and using Python for various tasks)

This introductory blog outlines our current offerings and gives you a glimpse into our future roadmap, detailing how we plan to evolve into a complete Python learning hub.

We currently have:

* The 1hr Guide to Python, designed to provide the core functionalities of Python without being overwhelming. It provides you just enough knowledge to begin coding cool things immediately in Python.

* Several guides on cool projects we can implement with Python.

## Future Roadmap

Of course, we don't plan on stopping there, our vision for LeetPython extends far beyond the basics. Our future roadmap is designed to not only deepen your understanding of Python but also explore its vast application across different domains. Here's a glimpse of what you can look foward to:
