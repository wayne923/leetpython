# What is The 1hr Guide to Python

Welcome to the 1hr Guide to Python! The 1hr Guide to Python is designed to provide the core functionalities of Python without being overwhelming. It provides you just enough knowledge to begin coding in Python immediately and doing all sorts of cool things.

The Guide is structured into bite-sized guides, all ordered in the correct progression. 

If you're a beginner we recommend that you start from the top and work your way down. Don't try to memorize everything written here. That's not how Python programmers work. Instead, they have a general idea of what they can do and then search for specifics whenever they need to.

We recommend that you use this Guide the same way! Once you finished reading through the entire Guide, think of it as a reference book that you can turn to whenever you need to remember a specific Python functionality.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid foundation in Python, ready to tackle more advanced topics or start working on your projects. Remember, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and you've just taken a significant one by choosing to learn Python with LeetPython.

We're glad to have you! Now let's begin learning!
