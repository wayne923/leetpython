# Dictionary

Control flow is how you tell your program to run different sections of code based on conditions or repeatedly. This section covers `if...else` statements and loops.

### Making Decisions with if...else
```python
if condition:
    # do something
else:
    # do something else
```

###  Repeating Actions with Loops
Understand how to use while and for loops to repeat actions.

Example of a while loop:
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
Write your own loop in your local Python environment or online like Google Colab and see how it changes the program flow!
