# Variables and Data Types

Variables are the building blocks of any program, and data types are the kind of data that can be stored in these variables. Learn about Python's dynamic typing and explore basic data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

### What is a Variable?
In Python, a variable is a name attached to a particular object. You can think of it as a label for a piece of data.

### Basic Data Types
- **Integers**: Whole numbers
- **Floats**: Decimal numbers
- **Strings**: Text
- **Booleans**: `True` or `False`
