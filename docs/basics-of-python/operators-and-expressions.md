# Operators and Expressions

Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Expressions are combinations of values and operators that are evaluated to produce another value.

### Understanding Operators
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`
- **Logical Operators**: `and`, `or`, `not`

### Building Expressions
Combine variables and operators to create expressions. For example:

```python
result = (10 + 5) * 2
print(result)
