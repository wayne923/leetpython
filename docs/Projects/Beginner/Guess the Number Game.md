Welcome to the **Guess the Number Game**  project! 

In this project we'll create the **Guess the Number Game**, which challenges players to guess a randomly selected number within a specified range and with a limited number of attempts. It's a fun and engaging way to apply your Python skills that's suitable for beginners and those looking to sharpen their understanding of control flow logic!

## Project Overview: Building the **Guess the Number Game**
As with all projects we undertake in life, we first need to define what we want to accomplish.

This isn't just about listing out everything we want the project to accomplish. It involves outlining the project's goals, its intended functionalitiy, its target audience, and its scope and boundaries. It helps to frame your through processes of all your Python projects in this fashion, so let's go through this exercise!

### Define the Purpose
The Guess the Number Game aims to provide a fun and interactive way for players to practice their problem-solving and critical thinking skills. It challenges players to guess a randomly selected number within a specified range and with a limited number of attempts, encouraging logical reasoning and decision-making based on feedback provided after each guess.

### Outline Core Features and Functionality
* Initialize Game Parameters: Set up the game by defining the start and end ranges of the number to be guessed, and select how many chances we have.
* Random Number Selection: The game will randomly select a number within a user-defined range at the start of each game session.
* Process User Input: Players input their guesses, which are validated to ensure they fall within the specified range.
* Feedback Mechanism: After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
* Attempt Tracking: The game tracks the number of attempts a player has made and informs them of how many attempts remain before the game ends.
* Ending the Game: The game concludes by announcing the player's victory if the correct number is guessed within the allowed attempts or reveals the secret number if the player fails to guess correctly.

### Boundaries and Limitations
* The game will only handle integer inputs within the specified range; guesses outside this range or non-integer inputs will prompt an error message asking for a valid input.

* The game is designed for a single player. Multiplayer functionality or competitive features are outside the current scope.

* The scope is limited to a command-line interface; graphical user interface (GUI) elements are not included in this version.

## Transitioning to Code: Structuring the Project's Logic

Now that we've outlined the purpose, core features, and boundaries and limitations of our **Guess the Number Game**, the next step is translating these concepts into a structured plan we can implement into code. This stage is about breaking down our high-level objects into logical components that will form the backbone of our code.

### Initialize Game Parameters
We need to find a way to define and store these values so that we can build the range, and we'll also need a way to define how many chances we have.

### Random Number Selection
We need code dedicated to generating and storing this random number to a specific variable, so that we can easily compare against it.

### Process Player Inputs and Provide Feedback
We'll need loops and conditional statements that validates the user's input against the allowed range of numbers, whether it is an acceptable input, and whether it's the correct number, and provides feedback message for each.

We'll need loops that loops that prompts for input, performs validation, and decides whether to continue accepting guesses based on the number of attempts remaining.

We'll need to code in conditional statements that compares the player's guess to the secret number and acceptable inputs and prints appropriate messages for each. 

### Attempt Tracking
We'll need to implement a counter that tracks the number of attempts made and compares it against the maximum number of allowed attempts.

### Ending the Game
We'll need to code in a final statement outside the feedback loops that displays the game's outcome.
