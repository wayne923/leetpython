title: Setup and Installation
---

Getting Python installed and ready on your computer is the first step towards becoming a Python programmer. Follow these instructions to install Python and set up your coding environment.

### Installation Guide
- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Follow installation instructions for your OS:
  - [Windows Installation](/docs/windows-installation)
  - [MacOS Installation](/docs/macos-installation)
  - [Linux Installation](/docs/linux-installation)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment
We recommend using Visual Studio Code as your IDE for Python development. [Setup Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

**Verify Installation**  
Run the following in your terminal:
`python --version`

You should see output like: `Python 3.9.1`



Now that you have Python installed, let's write your first Python script!

### Hello, World!
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
Try running this in your IDE or a Python interactive shell.

Understanding Your First Script
Let's break down what each part of your script is doing. Here's a simple explanation:
- print(): A function that outputs information to the screen.
- "Hello, World!": A string of text that is being printed out.

Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything right away! We'll cover all these concepts in detail later.
